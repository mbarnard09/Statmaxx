    No one had found a way to effetively trade on one of the fundemental principles of the stock market, emotion. Emotion is a huge 
    factor in determining the movement on a stock, especially in this market climate. Stocks can run up, or down for that matter solely
    based on a market feeling or emotion. This can come from news or it can come from nothing, regardless we want you to be ahead of the rest.
     With our sentiment tools you can analyze the market mood to stay ahead of emotion based movements. Another huge use for the 
     tools currently on the site are for breakouts. This is where the site really stands out from others. With the daily change analysis
     you are able to see when a stock has gone from virtually no chatter, to a rise in chatter, and finally to a breakout. Comment volume
     means actual volume but there is normally a hype up on forums before any of this happens and no single person can keep track of all 
     the different catalysts at once but with StatMaxx you can. The site is just starting out and more and more tools will be 
     written and upgrades will made to our algoithyms all the time. <br><br>
     We hope you enjoy the site and please donÂ´t hesitate to email us, <br>
     Thanks, <br>
